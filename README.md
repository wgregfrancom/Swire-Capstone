# Swire-Capstone
MSBA Capstone Completion project for Swire Coca-Cola 

Below is an introduction of my individual contribution to my team's project of forecasting Swire Coca-Cola's Innovation Products

# Business Problem Statement
Swire Coca-Cola continually introduces innovative products into the market and wants to optimize its production planning and inventory management for these novel beverages. The challenge for Swire is to forecast the demand for these new products accurately to ensure optimal production quantities, prevent out-of-stock and overproduction, minimize costs, and maximize customer satisfaction.

The purpose of this project is to accurately predict the weekly demand for innovative products. The focus will be on optimal production planning, cost minimization, customer satisfaction, and market location and date prediction. 

### Benefit of Solution
The benefits of the innovation product forecast are as follows:
- **Efficient Resource Allocation and Production Cost Reduction:** By accurately forecasting demand, Swire can allocate resources and materials more effectively, leading to significant cost savings. This efficiency reduces waste due to overproduction and minimizes storage costs associated with excess inventory.
- **Improved Market Responsiveness:** With precise demand predictions, Swire can rapidly respond to market changes and customer preferences. This agility ensures that new products are available where and when they are needed, enhancing the company's competitive edge in a changing market.
- **Enhanced Customer Experience:** Accurate demand forecasting helps maintain optimal inventory levels and reduces the likelihood of stockouts. This reliability in product availability ensures a consistent and satisfying customer experience, fostering loyalty and trust in the Swire brand.

## Analytics Approach
My approach involves a comprehensive exploratory data analysis process with the sample questions as a guide to acquiring insights. By using the historical data collected and delivered by Swire, patterns and factors influencing demand can be identified and explored. Following EDA, modeling could be implemented by either a dashboard, linear regression, or advanced feature engineering and algorithms to explore suitable forecasting models. Possibilities include time series and machine learning algorithms, anova, prophet, etc. The models will be trained, validated, and continuously improved based on real-time feedback, customer insights, and the dataset. The final step involves implementing the forecasting model into production planning and inventory systems. This approach aims to optimize resource allocation, improve market responsiveness and cost minimization, and enhance the overall customer experience for Swire's innovative products.

## Success Metrics
The success of this project will be measured by the ability to deliver a method that enhances production efficiency and inventory optimization. Key indicators include the accuracy of demand forecasting, reducing operational costs, and decreasing instances of overproduction and stock shortages. Additionally, success will be reflected in increased customer satisfaction, as evidenced by consistent product availability and positive market feedback. Collectively, these metrics will validate the project's impact on strengthening Swire’s position in the dynamic beverage market.

## Scope / Deliverables
Primary deliverables for this project will be the following: 
Detailed Report of Findings and Model Predictions: A comprehensive report encompassing analytical insights, detailed forecasts, and model accuracy assessments.
Customized Demand Forecasting Model: A tailored forecasting model for Swire to continuously forecast weekly demand for new products.

## Project Details
This project will be executed by the members of Team 4, the Fizz Wizards, and delivered on April 10, 2024. The following is a list of project milestones:

# Post-Project update and deliverables
Using historical data to predict new products is not without its challenges. Using competitor's data is valuable for creating a landscape analysis and setting benchmarks. At other times, the innovation product could be so similar to the legacy products of Swire that only using their data would be relevant. Due to the wide net of questions and product exploration, I opted to expand on my EDA worksheets and create a customizable dashboard in Tableau that members of Swire's Innovation Product team could access and view weekly unit sales. 

I created a Tableau dashboard that displays average unit sale trends and geography filtered by product characteristics data. Broken up by year with an average trendline, and a customizable reference band that shows a percentage of the weekly average. 

I like the idea of a dashboard for a few reasons:
- It is customizable, easy, and quick - anyone can select the traits, time period, and location they want and get a good estimate of sales without having to wait on the data analytics team.
- There are a lot of questions, and it made me think of past projects where you offered a solution and leadership would ask for info on alternatives. What if Swire said: “Great! What if it was diet? What if it was in Arizona? What if the flavor was snozzberries?”
- The data is anonymized and masked, and I wonder if there is institutional knowledge that is also masked that we, being so removed, would not know about. Subject matter experts are able to include and omit the relevant info independently of the data analyst. 

I hypothesized that for some of these questions, Swire’s data may be the best data to use based on the assumptions that it is a 
- Similar product
- Similar price
- Similar distribution 
- And the sales promotions would include both legacy and innovation products

Anecdotally, I was able to observe this in action on a recent road trip when we stopped at a gas station that was running a promotion of “buy 2 for $4” and watched my buddy buy a regular Coke and a Coke Spiced bottle.
